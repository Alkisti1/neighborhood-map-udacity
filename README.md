# Project 5: Neighborhood Map

## What It Is
This Web Application showcases a Chicago neighborhood with 7 default markers provided with more information when clicked

## Features
Filter locations: Includes a text input field or dropdown menu that filters the map markers and list items to locations
matching the text input or selection. Filter function runs error-free.

List View: A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered
subset of locations when a filter is applied. Clicking a location on the list displays unique information about the
location, and animates its associated map marker by bouncing.

Center Map: A compass icon that whenever clicked on reverts user back to the main focus of the map.
